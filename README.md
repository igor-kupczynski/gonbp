This is a go wrapper over the NBP currency exchange rates API.

[Narodowy Bank Polski](http://www.nbp.pl/) (NBP) is the central bank of the
Republic of Poland. Among other tasks it publishes the official exchange rate
of _ZÅ‚oty_ (the Polish currency) against other currencies. [NBP provides an
API to access the exchange rates](http://api.nbp.pl/en.html).

**Status**: Work in progress.
